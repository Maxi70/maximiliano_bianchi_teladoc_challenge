BDD automation framework: Selenium IDE
Browser: Chrome webdriver
Url tested: http://www.way2automation.com/angularjs-protractor/webtables/
Steps to follow: First of all I open Selenium IDE to créate the Project for the test scenarios.
 
Test Scenario 1:
STEP 1 – Create the test scenario named “User Created”.
 
STEP 2 – Click on record in Selenium IDE and specified the url to record the test scenario.
 
STEP 3 – While Selenium IDE is already recording run the test scenario. 
Selenium will now automatically complete the steps of the test scenario.
 
STEP 4 - After that, we check the user is created visualizing the data is entered on the table.
 
STEP 5 – Last but not least we run the test scenario in Selenium so we can validate the user is already created successfully.
 
Test Scenario 2:
STEP 1 – Create the test scenario named “User Deleted” and also start recording in the specified url.
 
STEP 2 – We proceed to delete the user and check that is already not visualizing on the table.
 
STEP 3 – Finally we run the test scenario and Selenium automatically complete the process and also we validate that the user is already deleted.
